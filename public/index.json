	"content": "Host Static Website on S3 and CloudFront Why Deploy a Static Website Using Amazon S3 and CloudFront? High Performance and Page Load Speed:  S3 stores static files (HTML, CSS, JS) on the cloud platform with automatic scaling and quick access. CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that helps distribute content to users from the nearest servers, reducing latency and increasing page load speed.  Cost Savings:  Deploying a static website on S3 is cost-effective, charging only based on storage and bandwidth usage, with no complex server management required. CloudFront optimizes bandwidth by caching content close to users, reducing direct access to S3 and thereby cutting costs.  Superior Scalability:  S3 and CloudFront automatically handle high traffic without complex configurations, suitable for websites with rapid growth needs. No worries about server overload when many users access the site simultaneously.  Enhanced Security:  CloudFront allows HTTPS setup, protecting data during transmission. Use Origin Access Control (OAC) to ensure only CloudFront has access to S3, protecting data from unauthorized access. AWS provides advanced security options like AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) and Shield to protect websites from DDoS attacks.  Easy Management and Automation:  Configuring, deploying, and managing a static website is straightforward via AWS Console or by using Infrastructure as Code with AWS CloudFormation or Terraform. AWS offers automatic backup and recovery features, ensuring service continuity.  Integration with Other AWS Services:  Easily integrate with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, or AWS Amplify to create more complex web applications from a static base. AWS IAM can be used to manage access permissions, providing additional security control.  Benefits of Using S3 and CloudFront:  Faster Response Time: Content is distributed from the nearest edge locations to users through CloudFront, reducing page load time. Data Security and Access Control: Security settings help better control who can access your content. High Reliability: AWS services have a high SLA, ensuring website availability. SEO Optimization and User Experience: Fast page load speeds improve SEO rankings and overall user experience. No Complex Maintenance Required: No worries about server maintenance or regular software updates, reducing workload for the development team.  Deploying a static website using S3 and CloudFront is simple, cost-effective, and provides a fast, secure, and stable web experience for users!\nMain Content  Prepare source code Create and Configure the S3 Bucket Config permission S3 bucket Create CloudFront Distribution  "

Click “Create bucket.” Name your bucket (e.g., your-bucket-name) and choose the appropriate region.   Disable the “Block all public access” option to allow public access to the bucket (or use CloudFront to restrict access).
